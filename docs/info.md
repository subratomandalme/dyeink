## About

We built DyeInk to focus on what matters: the writing. It features a clean, distraction-free editor and a reading experience that looks great on any device.

Under the hood, it uses a modern stack to ensure performance and reliability. You can host it yourself or deploy it to the cloud in minutes.

## Core Features

*   **Writing**: A powerful rich text editor that gets out of your way.
*   **Design**: A carefully crafted dark mode and responsive layout.
*   **Identity**: Connect your own custom domain easily.
*   **Security**: Secure authentication and data protection by default.
*   **Performance**: Built on React and Vite for instant page loads.

## Tech Stack

We use industry-standard technologies to keep the codebase maintainable and scalable.

*   **React** for the user interface
*   **TypeScript** for type safety
*   **Supabase** for database and authentication
*   **Vite** for fast development and building
*   **Zustand** for state management
